Python programming:

print("Walcom to the tip calculator.\n")
bill = float(input("What is your total bill? \n"))
precentage = int(input("What percentage tip you would like to give? (any number between 1-100) \n"))
split = int(input("And for the last question, how many people are share the bill?? \n"))

tip = bill * (1 + precentage / 100)
bill_split = round(tip / split)
print(f"Each person need to pay: {bill_split} Shekels.")
